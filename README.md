# marshmallow


This project focuses on implementing KNN in the field of Insurance.

Clients: Small Businesses
Objective: Help ease the isurance policy selection process

Description:  Our chatbot called "Marshmallow" is the client interface where in a new customer can input their details such as 
"Company name","number of years in industry","number of employees" etc.

Our alogorithm then matches the data with the historical client base and fetches the nearest neighbors i.e., the profiles that match
closely with the new customer data. 

This gives the client an opportunity to look at his peers for gaining insights on what are the policies being used by similar 
companies. This inturn makes the clients feel reassured about their decisions.

For the business perspective, this process builds a strong relationship and trust because of the extreme transperency of the process.

This also creates a cascading benefits starting from clients, brokers till the carriers.

We bring on a humongous digital transformation backed by data and analytics in comparison with the heavy usage of excel and macros
model at present.

Future scope:  Claimless and pay per use provided by our "PIA" (Personal Insurance Assistant) a.k.a Marshmallow which takes care
of our dynamically customizable risks, claims and renewals. 

To ease the usage, we would have voice input for Marshmallow's questions too.

The competitors (other insurance providers) quotes would be compared with, to show the advantage of our system.

Benchmark price for different risk metrics could be put forward for the business to put themselves in a map with theit competitors.

Personalized dashboard would be provided with total transparency on the risk metric the business has been provided for each aspect of the
insurance.
